          <p class="bodyTxt">
            In my bachelor thesis I focus on the concepts of surface as techne. I track the outset of the technical flatness back to the accessory used by the archaic accountants.

            In geometry, a surface is a continuous set of points that has length and breadth but no depth. What is the productivity of translating the three-dimensional space into a flat surface? According to Sybille Krämer,<abbr title="Donna Haraway, Staying with the Trouble with my old aunt who was a robot" rel="tooltip">&#9681;</abbr> since we are not able to see what is behind us (we have no eyes on the back of our heads), by inventing flatness, we introduce a controllable space.2 It is the capacity of the human mind to conceptualise from reality, push it through a process of interpretation, and eventually create a physical representation of it. Already thousands of years ago, early humans isolated bisons, aurochs, rhinoceroses, hyenas, horses and panthers from the patches of colour the eye sees in nature. The first painters projected the animal shapes onto the surfaces of subterranean grottos. The action of delineating the beasts from the natural background proves the emergence of the conceptual process of differentiation (structuring) between elements.3

            However, in the film “Cave of Forgotten Dreams”4 Werner Herzog unearths the surfaces of the Chauvet Cave, which break away from the category of a controllable space. In Chauvet, the flickering light erratically illuminates the uneven walls. The projection sculpts the subterranean shapes on the go, inviting the viewer’s imagination to engage in these rock-readings. Observing the light which embraces the stone phenomena moulded by the geological processes, early painters take part in the process of interpretation and modification. They finish whatever the surface suggests. Hence, the division between the author and the viewer remains blurred. These early painters performed the breaks in the flow of stone; they saw the mineral as movement- matter, untamed by the categories of time or concepts like electrons or atoms.5 Yet nowadays our knowledge of physics confirms that “(...) surfaces are also, in a sense, a separate state of matter, distinct from solids, liquids, and gases: surfaces are where the properties of matter change most rapidly.”6

            Surfaces exist in nature: the uncanny flatness of water, which succumbs to the laws of gravity; the iridescent camouflages of a bobtail squid, a beetle’s carapace, a peacock’s plumage. In this essay however, I focus on the concept of surface as techne. With the background in Industrial and Graphic Design, I am interested in how the market envisions both disciplines as primarily concerned with the production of surfaces.
